# Project Name: Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Description:
This project is a real estate price prediction model that aims to estimate the price of residential properties in Bengaluru, India. The model is based on various features like the total square feet area, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and the location of the property. It uses machine learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions, which can be helpful for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

## Project Demo:
The project demo is not provided here, but you can run the code in your local environment to see how the real estate price prediction works for different properties.

## Installation:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pint
   ```

## Usage:
1. Run the provided Python code in your preferred Python environment or IDE.
2. The code reads the data from "Bengaluru_House_Data.csv" file, cleans the data, and preprocesses it for further analysis.
3. The real estate price prediction model is trained using linear regression and evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation.
4. After the model is trained, you can use the `predict_price` function to estimate the price of a property based on its location, total square feet area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Configuration:
There is no specific configuration required for this project. However, if you want to fine-tune the model, you can modify the hyperparameters in the `find_best_model_using_gridsearchcv` function.

## Contributing:
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any bugs or want to add new features, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and test thoroughly.
